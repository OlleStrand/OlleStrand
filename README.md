# Welcome to my GitHub Page üëã
My name's Olle Strand. I'm an Engineering Student from Sweden.
I'm a Software and Web Developer. I focus on creating the system rather than the design. You wouldn't like to see that!  
  
I'm a computer-, game- and cargeek. My sparetime consists of a lot of programming, watching cars and less now than earlier but playing games! Some of my favorite cars are the *BMW M-Series*, *Ferrari* and *McLaren*. When it comes to programming I focus on *C# ASP.NET Core* backend developing, and more recently Stock Exchange robotics.  
  
In the future I want to lead a company as the CEO in Web Application Development and Cybersecurity. When it comes to future education my plans are pretty clear to achieve my goals, a degree in [*Master of Science in Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Management*](http://www.lth.se/utbildning/industriell-ekonomi/).

Statistics isn't quite right. Many of my projects requires a closed source code for security reasons! This is to ensure that code isn't stolen from Stock Exchange Robotics, Encryption Methods and more.
